# Genetic_algorithm_for_supply_chain

A Genetic algorithm approach for solving supply chain distribution problem.
In this example i've choosen to work with 2 plants 3 distributors and 3 retailers to keep things simple
Played around with different selection approaches and settled with tournament selection
Runned the algorithm for 1000 epochs , each epoch being 10 generations and reached near optimal solution.
